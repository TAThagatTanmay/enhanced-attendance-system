## 🔍 **THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE**

**Attendance tracking in most colleges is still done manually, usually through roll calls or paper registers. This consumes valuable teaching time and often leads to errors such as incorrect entries or proxy attendance. In larger classes, the issue becomes even harder to manage.**

**Additionally, faculty and administrators lack easy access to attendance insights, making it difficult to identify students at risk or to track patterns in engagement. As education undergoes digital transformation, continuing to rely on outdated systems creates unnecessary inefficiencies and delays.**

### **Specific Challenges Addressed:**
- ⏰ **5-10 minutes wasted** on manual roll calls per class
- 📊 **10-15% proxy attendance** fraud in traditional systems
- 🔍 **No real-time insights** for at-risk student identification
- 📈 **Scalability issues** with large classes (100+ students)
- 🌐 **Digital transformation gap** in modern education
